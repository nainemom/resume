        <h3>Client-Side</h3>
        <p>
            I mostly work as a frontend developer. I know how <b>Javascript</b> works, plus frameworks such as <b>Vue (advanced)</b>, <b>Nuxt (advanced)</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Angular-1.x</b> and also basics of <b>Typescript</b>.
            I've created various projects including <b>PWA</b>, Desktop Apps (using <b>Electron</b>), and Mobile Apps (using <b>Cordova</b>) and Tizen/WebOS apps (using web tecknologies).
            I understand how a Web-Project creates, maintains and finnaly works, so I just mention some other tools that I'm familier with:
            <b>Webpack</b>, <b>Rollup</b>, <b>CSS-Modules</b>, <b>Esling</b>, <b>SSR libs</b>, <b>Pre-render libs</b>, <b>Cordova</b>, and more.

        <h3>Server-Side</h3>
        <p>
            In my career there were a lot of times that I faced to server jobs as an <b>Amateur</b> developer. I understand <b>GNU/Linux</b> basics, also I can write a server-side code with <b>NodeJS</b>, connect it to DBs like <b>MySQL</b> and <b>MongoDB</b>, handle queues with <b>RabbitMQ</b> and finnaly manage images/containers/services via <b>Docker</b> and <b>Kubernetees</b>.
